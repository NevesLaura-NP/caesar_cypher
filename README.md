# Caesar Cypher Project

This is an encryption and decryption exercise utilizing python following a method said to be used by Caesar's armies. This exercise do as it follows:

1. Selects a string value as message
2. Selects a numeric key(`k`) value to encode the message
3. For each letter in the message:
a. Shifts each letter in the message 'k' letters forward.
b. Going past the last letter in our alphabet (`z`), the counting loops back to
the first letter (`a`).

In order to complete this algorithm, the ASCII was necessary to operate strings and integers.
